The solution is to correct the typo in the `@apply` directive:

```html
<div class="bg-red-500 @apply text-white">
  This text is now white on a red background.
</div>
```

This ensures that the `text-white` class is correctly applied, resulting in the expected styling.  Always double-check your Tailwind class names to prevent this issue.
